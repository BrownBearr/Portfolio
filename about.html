        <p class="firstAbout">
            I am a design and technology student at NYU IMA.

I'm a designer and maker from San Diego, CA currently living in NYC. I may be named after that famous Hindu god, but I'm definitely not as scary as him. 

If I'm not working on school stuff, you can typically find me either at my computer playing games, talking to friends on discord or IRL, and maybe cramming in my daily drawing before I forget about it.

        <p class="firstAbout">
            I am a design and technology student at NYU IMA.

I'm a designer and maker from San Diego, CA currently living in NYC. I may be named after that famous Hindu god, but I'm definitely not as scary as him. 

If I'm not working on school stuff, you can typically find me either at my computer playing games, talking to friends on discord or IRL, and maybe cramming in my daily drawing before I forget about it.

            Mechanical Keyboards
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
            I became a huge mechanical keyboard hobbyist during the pandemic. I currently own 4 keyboards that I work and tinker on. I found myself really enjoying the act building and typing on a custom mechanical keyboard. I pretty much advise my friends on how to build and buy a new keyboard.
            Currently Using: NK65 EE w/ C3 Banana Split Linear Switches

            Building

        <p class="description">
            I only discovered later down in life that I'm a huge fan of building electronic things. I built my PC when I was 14 and have been upgrading the same PC for the last 8 years. I have been building mechanical keyboards as I mentioned before, but I've been taking the hobby a bit further. I've been designing and building fighting game controllers which has become a huge passion of mine with whatever I can get my hands on!

            Vegetarian Food
        </h3>
        <p class="description">
            This one is sort of self-explanatory. I've been vegetarian my entire life, but I've pretty much eaten only Indian food and chipotle. I need new things to eat and places to eat at. If you have good vegetarian food recommendations, even just general food suggestions, I want them.
